= Streama

Streama is a simple Ruby activity stream gem for use with the Mongoid ODM framework.

== Install

  $ gem install streama
  
== Usage

=== Define Activities

Create an Activity model and define the activities and the fields you would like to cache within the activity.

class Activity
  include Streama::Activity
  
  activity :enquiry do
    actor :user, :cache => [:full_name]
    target :enquiry, :cache => [:subject]
    referrer :listing, :cache => [:title]
  end
  
end

=== Setup Actors

Include the Actor module in a class and override the default followers method.

  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Streama::Actor

    def followers
      ...
    end
  end

=== Setup Indexes

Create the indexes for the Activities collection. You can do so by calling the create_indexes method.

  Activity.create_indexes

=== Publishing Activity

In your controller or background worker:

  current_user.publish_activity(:enquiry, :target => @enquiry, :referrer => @listing)
  
This will publish the activity to the objects returned by the "followers" method in the Actor.

To send your activity to different receievers, pass in an additional :receivers parameter.

  current_user.publish_activity(:enquiry, :target => @enquiry, :referrer => @listing, :receivers => :friends) # calls friends method
  current_user.publish_activity(:enquiry, :target => @enquiry, :referrer => @listing, :receivers => current_user.find(:all, :conditions => {:group_id => mygroup}))

== Retrieving Activity

To retrieve all activity for an actor
  
  current_user.activity_stream
  
To retrieve and filter to a particular activity type

  current_user.activity_stream(:type => :activity_type)

If you need to return the instance of an :actor, :target or :referrer from an activity call the Activity#load_instance method

  activity.load_instance(:actor)
  
You can also refresh the cached activity data by calling the Activity#refresh_data method
  
  activity.refresh_data
  
== Compatibility

Streama is developed against Ruby 1.9.2 and Mongoid 2.0.0.rc7

== TODO

* Write more documentation, YARD
* Write more tests
* Benchmarks
