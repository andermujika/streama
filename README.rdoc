= Streama

Streama is a simple Ruby activity stream gem for use with the Mongoid ODM framework.

== Install

  $ gem install streama
  
== Usage

=== Define Activity

Define the activities and the fields you would like to store within the activity

  Activity.define(:enquiry) do
    actor :user, :store => [:full_name]
    target :enquiry, :store => [:subject]
    referrer :listing, :store => [:title]
  end

=== Setup Actors

Include the Actor module in a class and override the default followers method.

  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Streama::Actor

    def followers
      ...
    end
  end

You can define multiple activity streams to publish to in your Actor. 

The :followers parameter defines the method which returns recipients of the activity.

  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Streama::Actor
  
    activity_stream(:friends, :followers => :friends)
    activity_stream(:family, :followers => :family)
  
    def friends
      ...
    end
    
    def family
      ...
    end
  
  end

=== Publishing Activity

In your controller or background worker:

  current_user.publish_activity(:enquiry, :target => @enquiry, :referrer => @listing)
  
This will send to to the :default stream. 

To send an activity to a stream defined in your actor, pass in an additional :stream parameter.

  current_user.publish_activity(:enquiry, :target => @enquiry, :referrer => @listing, :stream => :friends)

== Compatibility

Streama is developed against Ruby 1.9.2 and Mongoid 2.0.0.rc7

== TODO

* Return activity objects instead of stream objects when reading an activity stream.
* Load an actor, target, referrer instance from an activity once retrieved.
* Change data caching to process on before_save rather than on assignment.
* Update stored data if an object is updated. (Not sure on the best way to do this yet)
* Write more documentation, YARD
* Write more tests
* Benchmarks

If you are looking for something that works with ActiveRecord take a look at fullsailors' {activity_stream}[https://github.com/fullsailor/activity_stream] which inspired this gem.

== Notes

* Streama inserts a record for every recipient of an activity. MongoDB handles thousands of inserts within milliseconds, so it should be able to handle most cases. If storage size is a problem consider using capped collections (Need to test this with mongoid).
